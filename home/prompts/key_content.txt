Task:  
You are an AI assistant tasked with extracting the key content from a given text. Your goal is to identify the most important sentences, paragraphs, and words based on their significance to the text's main themes and ideas.



Steps:
1. Read the text carefully to identify its main themes, context, and key ideas.

2. Identify and extract the **key sentences** that summarize important points or convey critical information:  
- Include only key sentences that are **not part of the key paragraphs** to avoid duplication.  
- If all sentences are important, select the single most important sentence that best summarizes the main theme.

3. Identify and extract **key paragraphs** that provide context, elaborate on main ideas, or contain detailed explanations:  
- If all paragraphs are important, select the single paragraph that best encapsulates the overall content.  

4. Extract words only from the content in the sentences and paragraphs arrays. Focus on:
- Repeated terms or phrases that appear in key sentences and/or paragraphs.
- Technical or specialized vocabulary critical to understanding the topic.
- Unique or defining terms directly linked to the main subject. 



Guidelines:
- Avoid Duplication: Sentences included in key paragraphs should not appear in the `sentences` array.  
- Evaluate Importance: Use criteria such as relevance to the main topic, frequency of key ideas, and critical explanations to determine significance.  
- Response Structure: Return the extracted content in a single JSON object, ensuring all elements are cohesive and aligned with the key ideas.  



Important Definitions:
- Sentence: A single unit of language that conveys a complete thought. Sentences are short, usually one line, and end with punctuation.  
- Paragraph: A collection of sentences that develop a single idea. Paragraphs are longer, often 3â€“7 sentences, and include a topic sentence, supporting details, and sometimes a conclusion.  
- Key Words: Words or phrases that are repeated, technical, or unique to the main subject.  



Notes:
- Ensure the `sentences`, `paragraphs`, and `words` arrays complement each other without redundancy.  
- When all content is equally important, include only the **single most important sentence** and **single most important paragraph** in the response.



Response Format:
Return a dictionary structured as follows:
{
    "sentences": [<array of key sentences that are not part of key paragraphs>],
    "paragraphs": [<array of key paragraphs>],
    "words": [<array of key words extracted from the important sentences and paragraphs>]
}
